# Summer_Internship
This repository contains all the work done during my internship at IIT-Kanpur.

In a nutshell, this project talks about how data from malwares and benign files can be used for machine learning analysis. 

I have also provided some JSON file data for testing the codes.

Please feel free to download and test code for yourself.
